Press Ctrl + PrtScn keys. The entire screen changes to gray including the open menu. Select Mode, or in earlier versions of Windows, select the arrow next to the New button. Select the kind of snip you want, and then select the area of the screen capture that you want to capture.

## Capture a Screenshot in Windows 10 With Print Screen

The easiest way to capture a screenshot in Windows 10 is to press the PrtSc + Windows keyboard combination on your keyboard. You'll see your screen flash very briefly, and the screenshot will save to the Pictures > Screenshot folder on your computer. But while this is the easiest way, it may not be the best way.

One problem you may encounter if you use this keyboard combination and you're running Windows 10 with two or more computer monitors, you'll capture the screens on both monitors, as shown below. If what you're trying to do is grab a single screen or part of a screen, you have some additional options in Windows 10 that might work better.

## How to Take a Screenshot 

The basic way to take a screenshot in Windows is the same way no matter what version of Windows you're using, and it's very easy: press the PrtScn key on the keyboard.

* PrtScn: Pressing the button once saves a screenshot of the entire screen. If you have multiple monitors connected, a single press of the print screen button will save a screenshot of all the screens in one single image.
* Alt+PrtScn: Press these buttons at the same time to take a screenshot of a single window that you're focused on. Select the window once to make sure it's in focus, and then hit these keys.
* Win+PrtScn: Using the Windows key with the print screen button (in Windows 8 and newer) will take a screenshot of the whole screen and then save it in the default Pictures folder in a subfolder called Screenshots (e.g. C:\Users\[user]\Pictures\Screenshots).
